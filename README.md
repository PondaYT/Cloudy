## 2. Sideload an unsigned IPA

### Windows

1. Make sure you have the downloadable binary version of iTunes and iCloud installed on your PC. Do __NOT__ install the version of iTunes or iCloud from the Microsoft Store.

6. Once you login to your iCloud account and click through any remaining dialog boxes, AltStore will be installed on your phone.
**LEAVE ALTSERVER RUNNING ON YOUR PC!**
AltServer signs Apps remotely, and will do it whenever it sees your iDevice on the same network, so make sure that it stays running so you can continue to use your Apps without issue.
7. Download the latest **.ipa** file as provided from our [Discord](https://discord.gg/9sgTxFx) server
